Ecstasy Editor, a notepad fully built in Qt. I would like to say THANK YOU to @fraaaaa4 for helping us with the design and giving us ideas for the notepad.

It was first set as a project to learn Qt framework but then I liked it so much that I decided to make it real.
This is my first project in Qt so if you find any bugs of glitches do not hesitate to tell me! :)
