Ecstasy Editor, a notepad fully built in Qt. 
This notepad has many features such as opening and saving files, creating documnets and many more!
I made this using Qt, a GUI framework for C++.
The design for this notepad came to me when I decided to make something that looks like Notepad++ but with the features with Word2019. So Ecstasy Editor was born!

Special thanks to @fraaaaa4, creator of Starboy Notepad, go give it a check!

It was first set as a project to learn Qt framework but then I liked it so much that I decided to make it real.
This is my first project in Qt so if you find any bugs of glitches do not hesitate to tell me! :)
